  - `wp-login.php`

## üß∞ Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone This Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

```

### 2. Download the WordPress Core

- Go to https://wordpress.org/download/
- Extract the ZIP file
- Copy **everything except** the `wp-content` folder into this project directory.

Your final structure should look like this:

```
/your-repo
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-admin/          ‚Üê from official WordPress download
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-includes/       ‚Üê from official WordPress download
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-content/        ‚Üê from this repo (KEEP THIS ONE)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-login.php
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-config.php (optional)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you **do not overwrite** the `wp-content` folder from this repo.

### 3. Create a Local Database

Create a new MySQL database using your preferred tool (phpMyAdmin, TablePlus, MySQL CLI, etc.).

Example:

```
Database name: wordpress_local
Username: root
Password: (leave blank or set your password)
Host: localhost
```

---

### 4. Set Up `wp-config.php`

If `wp-config.php` is not already provided, copy it from the sample file:

```bash
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
```

Update the following lines:

```php
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress_local' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', '' ); // Use your local MySQL password
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

Save and close the file.

---

### 5. Run the Site

Start your local web server and open your browser:

```
http://localhost/your-repo-folder/
```

You‚Äôll be guided through the standard WordPress installation steps.

## üê≥ Docker Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker, here‚Äôs a simple setup:

### 1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: root

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
```

### 2. Run the containers:

```bash

```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to install WordPress.
